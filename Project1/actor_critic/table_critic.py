"""
Your system must provide two different implementations for the critic: a simple table of assocations (e.g.,
Python dictionary) between states and values, and a neural network that maps states to values.
The neural network must be implemented in one of the standard deep-learning packages, such as Tensorflow
or PyTorch. See the section entitled Function Approximators in the Critic in actor-critic.pdf for details of
this implementation.
